Multiplayer browser games with JSP and JS: JQuery, Angular JS.
On the server side I use servlet 3.0 push technology.
On the client side I use Angular JS with JQuery and JQuery UI.
Recently I've integrated the Spring framework on the server. I'm planning to move it entirely to Spring MVC to fully take advantage of IOC/DI.
